<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Mark John Ariban — a 33-year-old Filipino who is passionate about continuous learning, technology, and
  storytelling through digital platforms. I currently reside in the Philippines and live a vibrant, purpose-driven life
  where I'm balancing both professional responsibilities and personal growth.</p>

<p>I'm single and currently working at High Light Tours Inc., a company where I contribute with dedication,
  professionalism, and a keen eye for detail. Outside of my day job, I’m actively pursuing an online course in web
  development. This journey into coding and digital design reflects my strong desire to upgrade my skills and transition
  into the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in movies and anime, which not only entertain me but also fuel my
  creativity and imagination. Whether it's an emotional Studio Ghibli film or an intense action-packed series, I find
  stories a powerful way to understand different cultures and human experiences.</p>

<p>Driven by curiosity and a hunger for growth, I’m always eager to learn — be it through formal education, everyday
  experiences, or engaging conversations. I believe that every day presents a new opportunity to improve, and I embrace
  that with optimism and commitment.</p>

<p>As I continue to explore new paths in tech and digital media, I look forward to connecting with like-minded
  individuals, taking on exciting projects, and building a future I can be proud of.</p>
